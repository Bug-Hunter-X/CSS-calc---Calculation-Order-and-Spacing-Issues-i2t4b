To address the calculation order issue, one solution is to use a different approach that avoids the percentage calculation altogether. For example, if the element's width must be 50% minus 10px, you may need to adjust the parent element's width or use Javascript to dynamically calculate the width based on the parent's size.

For the spacing issue, carefully review the `calc()` syntax.  Ensure there are no extra spaces and that operators (+, -, *, /) are correctly placed. Removing any unnecessary spaces around the operators usually resolves the issue.

Here's an example demonstrating a potential solution to the width calculation using Javascript:

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.element');
const parentWidth = element.parentElement.offsetWidth;
element.style.width = `${parentWidth * 0.5 - 10}px`;
```

This approach ensures the calculation is performed accurately based on the parent element's width before setting the element's width.
